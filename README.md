# Football-Prediction
### Goals: 
* Predict output of NFL football players from previous data.

### Notes from first Meeting:
* Feasible to predict yards, catches, touchdowns etc.
* Pick one final algorithm to work on.
* Make sure we complete all the requirements.
* Split up the project and work on our own but check in Thursday mornings.

### Timeline:
Meet again on morning of Thursday October 10:
* Before meeting, look at data and figure out what we can do.

Goal for midpoint Nov. 13:
* Have a minimal viable algorithm that predicts something.

### Data:
We are using data gathered by and described by https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats.


### Final Report Ideas:
* Visual: models performance (MSE) vs baseline week by week on test year/weeks (2017 week 1 - 16).
